Problem: Check for Anagrams
        Write a Java program that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.
        An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase,
        typically using all the original letters exactly once.
        Ignore spaces and consider the strings to be case-insensitive
        (i.e., 'A' and 'a' should be treated as the same character).

        Example:
        Input: "listen", "silent"
        Output: Yes (because "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other)

        Input: "Hello", "World"
        Output: No (because "Hello" and "World" are not anagrams)*/

public class Anagrams {
}
